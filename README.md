This project made me realize how important comments are. I got most of my html done and started the css and things got really messy really fast. I kept repeating class names anytime i wanted to change something and realized that I needed to clean it up. I went through my html and separated the code the way that I had the page separated in my mind. Then I went through and did the same thing for css. This made my code much easier to read and therefore it was easier to change.

This really opened up my eyes to how important it is to leave comments and organize your code. I haven't worked on any group projects yet, but I can imagine how crazy it can get if the code isn't organized.
